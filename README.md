# Project Ascension Mockup User Interface
An example user interface for [Project Ascension](http://reddit.com/r/Project_Ascension), based on /u/assh---'s design. Built on the Qt framework for C++ and currently targeting Windows machines. Code and styling for the borderless window system is pulled from deimos1877's [BorderlessWindow](http://github.com/deimos1877/BorderlessWindow).

### General Info
This design takes inspiration primarily from /u/assh---'s [mockup interface](http://i.imgur.com/i4SsCPH.png), though a few changes have been made to accommodate general community opinions.

This code currently targets only Windows machines, due to the limitations presented by the WinAPI and Qt's frameless windows. However, a large portion of its code is isolated from the window styling, and can be utilized independently.
